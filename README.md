SLIDES:  https://duke.is/llm-nsoe

An invited presentation with Jenna Strawbridge to the [NSOE](https://nicholas.duke.edu/) on ways that LLMs may replace traditional resources. The presentation will consider the following:

-   What are the tendencies of the big three: ChatGPT \[and MS CoPilot\], Claude, Gemini, plus GitHub CoPilot
-   The importance of verification
    -   Are the responses answers?
    -   Do I want a **prediction** of clean data or do I want to **verify** that the data re clean?
-   Prompting out a good "response" in general, or for AI-assisted coding. i.e. [**Prompt Engineering**](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW1iEoJ)
-   Approach Rubrick
    -   Do I want type-ahead buffers (e.g. AI-paired / or AI-assisted coding)
    -   Natural language as an **alternative avenue into documentation**?
-   Reproducibility
    -   Are the responses reproducible?
    -   Is the code reproducible?

Where does AI excel and miss: best practices when using AI.
